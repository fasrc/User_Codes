[Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), short for Formula Translation, is one of the oldest high-level programming languages, first developed by IBM in the 1950s. It was primarily designed for numerical and scientific computing tasks, making it highly suitable for complex mathematical calculations. Known for its efficiency and speed, Fortran has undergone several revisions over the years, with the latest version being Fortran 2018. Despite its age, Fortran remains relevant in fields such as engineering, physics, and research where performance and numerical accuracy are paramount. Its robustness in handling large-scale scientific and engineering applications, array-oriented programming, and its ability to optimize code for parallel computing have contributed to its longevity in the realm of technical computing.
