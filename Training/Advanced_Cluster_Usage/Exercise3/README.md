# Job Efficiency - Scaling

### Environment setup

To compute the speedup and parallel efficiency, and generate a scaling figure, in this exercise we first need to create a `conda` environment with the required Python packages. The environment is created by submitting the `run_speedup.sbatch` script to the queue:

```bash
sbatch run_speedup.sbatch
```
