# Parallel Computing Exercise

This repository contains a coding exercise demonstrating parallel computing using SLURM job arrays. The exercise involves calculating the sum of integers from 1 through N using both a serial and a parallel approach.

## Files Included

- **`serial_sum.py`**  
  A Python script that computes the sum of integers from 1 through N using a simple serial approach.  
  The script reads the value of `N` from the environment variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` to enable running multiple instances in parallel via a SLURM job array.

- **`run.sbatch`**  
  A SLURM batch script used to submit a job array to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. This script allows multiple instances of `serial_sum.py` to run in parallel, each calculating the sum for a different value of N.

- **`output_100.out`, `output_200.out`, `output_300.out`**  
  Output files generated by SLURM for specific tasks in the job array. Each file contains the result of running `serial_sum.py` for a particular value of N.

## How to Run the Exercise

1. **Prepare the environment**  
   Ensure SLURM is available on the target HPC cluster.

2. **Submit the SLURM job**  
   Run the following command to submit the job array:
   ```bash
   sbatch run.sbatch
   ```
   This command will submit a job array with multiple tasks, each of which runs `serial_sum.py` for a different value of N.

3. **Check the output**  
   Once the job completes, output files (`output_<N>.out`) will be generated, containing the computed sums.

## Example Output

For a task with `N = 100`, the output file (`output_100.out`) will contain:
```
The sum of integers from 1 through 100 is 5050.
```

## Purpose of the Exercise

This exercise illustrates:

- How to set up and run a parallel computing task using SLURM job arrays.
- The difference between serial and parallel execution.
- How job arrays can be used to parallelize tasks that independently compute results for different input values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SLURM workload manager
