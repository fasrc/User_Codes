The below examples are intended to illustrate the use of PHDF5 on the Cannon cluster. The specific examples are implemented in Fortran, but the could be easily translated to C or C++, for instance:

* [Example 1](Example1/): Parallel HDF5 - write 1D array of dimension 100
* [Example 2](Example2/): Parallel HDF5 - write 2D array of dimension 20x30 
* [Example 3](Example3/): Parallel HDF5 - write 3D array of dimension 10x30x8
