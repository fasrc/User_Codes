## Security

Please, **carefully** read Harvard's [AI guidelines](https://huit.harvard.edu/ai/guidelines) and [Generative AI tool comparision](https://huit.harvard.edu/ai/tools).

You can only use openAI and other genAI on your own is if it is not Harvard work related and/or public, non-sensitive data (data security level 1).

For data security ***levels 2 and 3***, you need to work with your school to discuss your needs. It is your responsibility to make sure you get setup with the appropriate contractual coverage and environment -- esp. to avoid having the model learn from your input and leak sensitive information.
